Reading Group for UC Berkeley CEE

### Our Goals

- Discuss papers at the intersection of data science, computer science, statistics, and civil engineering applications. 
- Learn about research directions in the scientific community and potentially find cool things to **apply to our own research**.
- Help each other to understand research that is different from our background through discussion.

### Research Topic Examples

- Reinforcement learning for controls of civil systems 
- Machine learning for structural health monitoring
- Machine learning for "surrogate" modeling
